# FlightSurety

FlightSurety is a sample application project for Udacity's Blockchain course.

## Testing Notes

- Tested using GUI Ganache app with mnemonic in `start-ganache-cli.sh`.
- Requires 30 total accounts (First account as contract owner, 1-5 as Airlines, 6-9 as Passengers, and remaining 20 are used as Oracle accounts)
- DAPP contract calls are made using the currently selected account in MetaMask (imported accounts with same mnemonic as above).
- Requires a page refresh after MetaMask account change to register.
